Visual.js
=========

Visual.js is a JavaScript 3D framework which is extremely easy to use.
It's based upon Three.js, but hides all the fancy stuff, and provides a simple API for you.

With Visual.js, you can rapidly build up a scene without mastering much high level 3D knowledge. 
And it's great to be used for quick prototyping, scientific or educational purpose.
